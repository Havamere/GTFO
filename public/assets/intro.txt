Detective London Fog is the most oblivious, imprudent, and lumbering fellow of the English Guard that anyone has ever been unfortunate enough to have seen but I say, he has unraveled more mysteries than that lovable American group of pesky teenagers. 

Detective Fog has been working strenuously for the past few years without a quiet holiday so he has decided to take his buggy out to the countryside all by himself. That was the idiotic mistake that led to this fantastic adventure that is about to begin!

Start of Story

Oh bother, my buggy is making an odd noise and it looks like it will be getting dark shortly. I am going to need to find a place to stay the night and pray they have a telephone. 

Hmm, I believe I see something up ahead. 

What luck! Look at this place! I’m sure it’s sparkling clean, harmless, and full of exquisite ladies and gents! Oh, I hope there is a party going on this evening! This will be a lovely place to stay and I may be the only Guest here! Nothing odd about that since I am in the countryside and this is the only house I have seen for miles and miles…well any who! 
Such good fortune finding this charming abode! Let’s go inside shall we!? What could possibly go wrong!?

About the game

The user gets 4 choices for each room and has to choose the correct 3 to get out of the room. If user takes wrong set of items then they are prompted by the fellow saying Hmm, I am not quite sure how these will get me out but I will give it a shot! Nope, still no luck…
