Attic – Final Room 

Wow! Look at that window and how much space is in here! All that’s taking up space is this charming little children’s rocking horse and an antique dresser. They should move all that junk from downstairs to up here. They could really get this house to function better. Nevertheless, with the items I have retrieved, I should be able to escape through that window...

Winning items: phone, scotch, and key.

With the winning items: Eureka!

With losing items: Oh bother, I will not get out with these.
